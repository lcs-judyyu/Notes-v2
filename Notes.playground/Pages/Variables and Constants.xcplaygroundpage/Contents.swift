// A "variable" is a place to store a single piece of information
// We can find the "data type" for a variable by Option-clicking the variable name

// Data types
// String: stores text, like "abc"
// Int: stores whole numbers like -7, 0, 15, etc.
// Double: store numbers with decimal portions

// This is an example of a String data type
// Create a variable named "age", which has a data type of my age
var age = 16

// Create a variable named "balance", which has a data type of ...
var balance = 1256.24

//Create a piece of text
var greeting = "Hello, playground"

// Constant are just like variables except that once set, the value cannot change
let approxiamtelyPi = 3.14
//approxiamtelyPi = 4
